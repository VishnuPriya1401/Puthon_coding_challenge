# Python Coding Challenge

## PRODUCT PRICE UPDATE SCRIPT

This python script reads csv files (products.csv, sales.csv) and analyzes the stock and quantity sold details, to generate new prices for the products based on the conditions applied.
The new price which is calculated is then added to the "updated_prices.csv" file, along with the product's "sku" and "current price" values.
